Fraud Detection System Using LightGBM
Project Overview
This project focuses on building a robust fraud detection system using machine learning techniques. The goal is to accurately identify fraudulent transactions in a large dataset of financial transactions to prevent monetary losses and protect users.

Dataset
The model is trained on a transaction dataset containing features such as transaction amount, transaction time, user location, device information, and other behavioral patterns.

Key Features
Transaction amount and frequency

Time and location anomalies

Device and IP address changes

User behavior patterns such as average transaction size and transaction intervals

Approach
Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.

Feature engineering: Creating new features to capture user transaction behavior.

Model selection: Using LightGBM, a gradient boosting algorithm optimized for speed and accuracy.

Handling data imbalance: Techniques like SMOTE and class weighting to address skewed fraud data.

Model evaluation: Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC were used to measure performance.

Results
The model demonstrated high recall and balanced precision, effectively detecting fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives.
